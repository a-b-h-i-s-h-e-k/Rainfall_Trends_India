# Rainfall Trends and Analysis in India
- This project provides an in-depth analysis of rainfall patterns in India from 1901 to 2015, using statistical techniques, machine learning, and time-series forecasting. It includes data preprocessing, anomaly detection, clustering, and forecasting to explore trends and provide actionable insights into rainfall distribution.

# Features and Methodologies

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Seasonal and Annual Trends:
    - Visualization of annual rainfall patterns and monthly seasonal variations.
    - Identification of high and low rainfall months using averages and distributions.
- Rolling Averages:
    - Calculation of rolling averages to highlight long-term trends in annual rainfall.
2. Anomaly Detection

- Isolation Forest:
    - Detection of drought and extreme rainfall years using unsupervised learning.
    - Monthly and Seasonal Anomalies:
    - Analysis of anomalies at the monthly level to detect extreme weather events.

3. Correlation Analysis
- Correlation between monsoon (June–September) rainfall and other seasonal rainfall distributions.
- Insights into interdependence between different seasons.

4. Clustering Using K-Means
- Categorization of years into Dry, Normal, and Wet based on rainfall patterns.
- Use of K-Means clustering to segment years into meaningful rainfall categories.

5. Time-Series Forecasting

- Prophet Model:
      - Forecasting annual rainfall for the next 20 years with confidence intervals.
      - Interactive and static visualizations of forecasted trends.

- Execute cells sequentially to analyze and visualize the data.

 - Customizing Analysis:
 
- Modify parameters (e.g., contamination for anomaly detection, number of clusters in K-Means).
- Update the forecast period by changing the periods parameter in the Prophet model.

# Project Outcomes
- Understanding Historical Trends:
- Comprehensive insights into India’s rainfall patterns over more than a century.
